End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[Verse 2]
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
[Post-Chorus]
(Master, master, master, master)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

[Refrain]
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[Laughter]
